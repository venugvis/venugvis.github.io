									<h2><a href="index.html">Hello, I'm Vishnu...<br /></h2>
										<h3>Data Analyst | Program Manager</a></h3>
                                        <p>
                                            My current work involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. 
                                            I’ve recently built machine learning models to <a href = "https://github.com/venugvis/waze-customer-churn">predict customer churn</a>, 
                                            <a href = "https://github.com/venugvis/salifort-employee-retention-prediction">employee attrition</a>, and 
                                            <a href="https://github.com/venugvis/customer-purchase-prediction">purchase behavior</a> — applying techniques like Random Forest and XGBoost, 
                                            and tuning them using GridSearchCV. I’ve also been diving deeper into communicating insights effectively through clean visualizations and structured notebooks.
                                        </br></br>
                                            I’m currently pivoting into the data analytics space full-time after a 5+ year career at Amazon, where I worked across technical support, program management, and ticketing operations. 
                                            I hold a Master’s in English Linguistics and Literature, and recently completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, which helped solidify my skills in Python, regression, and classification modeling.
                                        </br></br>    
                                            In my spare time, I’ve been building my personal analytics portfolio and learning how to present projects through GitHub and my own website. 
                                            I also took time to reconnect with family after years of balancing work and grad school — a pause that recharged me and gave me the space to realign my career intentionally.
                                        </br></br>    
                                            However, I haven’t always worked with data. I originally studied humanities and worked in roles that focused on communication, writing, and user support. 
                                            But even early on, I was drawn to structure and systems — and I slowly gravitated toward more technical responsibilities, especially when I realized how much I enjoyed solving business problems through data.
                                        </br></br>   
                                            After working with advanced Excel, Tableau, and internal data analytics tools during my stint at Amazon, I realized I’d been doing analytics all along — I just needed the technical foundation to take it further. 
                                            So I committed to learning Python, SQL, machine learning, and model evaluation. 
                                        </br></br>   
                                            Now, with three full-stack ML case studies under my belt (as of 15 April 2025.. there are more coming..), I’m confident in my ability to turn raw data into insights that drive decisions.
                                        </br></br>   
                                            In my free time, I enjoy playing my guitar, iot projects, reading, spending time with family and my partner. 
                                            I’m always seeking new knowledge, always curious, fast learner, and excited to collaborate with teams that care about using data to solve real problems.
                                            </p>
